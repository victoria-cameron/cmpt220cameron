Victoria,

About your programs...

Functionality

- There are programs missing.

Please make sure you read the problems well; follow instructions.


Style Check

- Some programs are missing the header: -1pt
  /**
   * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
   * author: student name
   * course: CMPT 220
   * assignment: project 1
   * due date: August 30, 2003
   * version: 1.3
   * 
   * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
   * type.
   */

Please make sure you follow the style guidelines and that your programs can be
compiled using javac. Penalties will be higher as the semester moves forward.

Peace,
