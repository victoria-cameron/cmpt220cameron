About your programs...

Functionality

- All programs function correctly as required.


Style Check

- All programs are missing the part that explains what the program does in
  the header: -1pt
  /**
   * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
   * author: student name
   * course: CMPT 220
   * assignment: project 1
   * due date: August 30, 2003
   * version: 1.3
   * 
   * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
   * type.
   */

Please make sure you follow the style guidelines. Penalties will be higher as
the semester moves forward.


Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
